#### About Me

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a full-time Data Analyst with around 3 years of experience working across the data lifecycle â€” from extraction and transformation to visualization and business decision support. My day-to-day revolves around using SQL, Python (Pandas/Numpy), and Power BI to drive data-backed decisions across teams.

I regularly query and manipulate large datasets for use cases like lead tracking, campaign performance, and sales/product analytics. For deeper data wrangling and enrichment, I use Python â€” often automating repetitive tasks or modeling complex logic when SQL alone doesnâ€™t cut it.

Much of my work goes into building interactive and insightful dashboards in Power BI, writing custom DAX measures and optimizing report performance using tools like DAX Studio and Power Query.

Collaboration is also a key part of my workflow â€” gathering requirements from cross-functional stakeholders (like sales and marketing), presenting actionable insights to business leads, and refining solutions based on feedback.

Youâ€™ll also find me troubleshooting data pipeline issues, standardizing KPIs/metrics, mentoring junior analysts, and contributing to documentation and reporting automation efforts.

On this GitHub, I share projects that reflect my skills and interests â€” from SQL and data transformation scripts to Python notebooks and Power BI dashboards. I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and exchanging ideas, so feel free to explore or reach out.

Thanks for stopping by!
